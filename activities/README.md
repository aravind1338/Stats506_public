# WEEK 1 ACTIVITIES

##  part 1

We downloaded the data, extracted the header row and output it to a file with one name per line. We then got the required column numbers as a comma separated string, and then cut out the appropriate columns.

## part 2

Continuing from part1, we added command line arguments for the file name and regular expression, and eliminated the temporary file.
